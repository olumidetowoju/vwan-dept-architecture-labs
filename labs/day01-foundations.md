# 🧱 Day 1 – Foundations & Prerequisites

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Understand Virtual WAN concepts and analogy.  
2. Prepare your Azure subscription and providers.  
3. Create naming variables for reusability.  
4. Verify permissions and no costs yet.

---

## 🧠 Virtual WAN in Simple Terms
Azure Virtual WAN is a **global network service** that lets you connect VNets, branches, and remote users to Microsoft’s backbone with central management.

Imagine it as a **world of airports** where:
- The **WAN** is the airline alliance.  
- Each **Hub** is a regional airport.  
- **Firewalls / NVAs** are security checkpoints.  
- **Routing Intent** are signboards that decide which travelers go through security.

    User->>CLI: Run "az login" and verify subscription
    CLI->>Azure: Authenticate and fetch subscription details
    CLI->>Azure: Register required providers<br>(Network, Firewall, VirtualWAN)
    CLI->>RG: Create new Resource Group (clab-dev-rg)
    RG-->>User: Confirmation → provisioningState = Succeeded
    Note over RG: Only the Resource Group exists after Day 1<br>All other components come in Day 2+

⚙️ Setup Environment
1️⃣ Confirm Subscription
bash
Copy code
az account show -o table
✅ Ensure subscription ID = 56d9a9d0-65a3-4aea-9957-ff103f641f9c.

2️⃣ Register Required Providers
bash
Copy code
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Firewall
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.VirtualWAN
3️⃣ Define Naming Variables
bash
Copy code
LOCATION=eastus
PREFIX=clab
ENV=dev
SUFFIX=001
RG=${PREFIX}-${ENV}-rg
VWAN=${PREFIX}-${ENV}-vwan
VHUB=${PREFIX}-${ENV}-hub-${LOCATION}
4️⃣ Create Resource Group
bash
Copy code
az group create -n $RG -l $LOCATION
✅ Output should show provisioningState = Succeeded.

🧩 Department Profiles
Department	Focus	Internet Traffic	Private Traffic
Dept A – Strict	Maximum Security	via Firewall	via Firewall
Dept B – Balanced	Mix of Speed & Safety	via Firewall	Direct
Dept C – Performance	Low Latency	via Firewall	Direct

🧭 Diagram – Current State

    participant CLI as Azure CLI / Portal
    participant Azure as Azure Subscription
    participant RG as Resource Group (clab-dev-rg)

    CLI->>Azure: Create resource group (az group create)
    Azure->>RG: provisioningState = Succeeded
    Note over RG: End of Day 1:\nOnly Resource Group exists\n(No cost incurred)
```

---

✅ Verify
bash
Copy code
az group list -o table
``>
You should see `clab-dev-rg`.

---

## 💰 Cost Check
All operations today are **Free**. No compute or network billing.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup (Optional)
```bash
az group delete -n $RG --yes --no-wait
🧭 Next Preview
Tomorrow (Day 2) you’ll:
